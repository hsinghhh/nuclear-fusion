<br> <br>
In thermochemistry, it is defined as a reaction for which the overall standard enthalpy change ΔH⚬ is negative. Simplified, an exothermic reaction expressed in a chemical equation is the reactants → products + energy. For example, combustion, the thermite reaction, combining strong acids and bases, polymerizations. As an example in everyday life, hand warmers make use of the oxidation of iron to achieve an exothermic reaction. Uncontrolled exothermic reactions, those leading to fires and explosions, are wasteful because it is difficult to capture the released energy. Nature effects combustion reactions under highly controlled conditions, avoiding fires and explosions, in aerobic respiration so as to capture the released energy. In exothermic reactions, more energy is released when the bonds are formed in the products than is used to break the bonds in the reactants. Exothermic reactions are accompanied by an increase in temperature of the reaction mixture.

<p align = left class = gen-exo> WHAT IS AN ENDOTHERMIC REACTION?</p>
<p align = left class = other> An endothermic process is a chemical or physical process that absorbs heat from its surroundings. In terms of thermodynamics and thermochemistry, it is a thermodynamic process with an increase in the enthalpy H of the system. In endothermic reactions, more energy is absorbed when the bonds in the reactants are broken than is released when new bonds are formed in the products. Endothermic reactions are accompanied by a decrease in temperature of the reaction mixture.  Endothermic reactions are the opposite of exothermic reactions. They absorb heat energy from their surroundings. This means that the surroundings of endothermic reactions are colder as a result of the reaction. Therefore, endothermic reactions are bad for heat generation as they generate cold, the opposite of heat, </p>

<p align = middle class = gen-exo> GENERATING HEAT USING AN EXOTHERMIC REACTION: </p>
<p align = middle class = other> To generate heat using an exothermic reactions, we need to create bonds between hydrocarbons. One example of this is biomass burning, or the the burning of dry leaves, woods and coals to get energy as heat in exothermic reaction. We burn these things to get heat energy. These are hydrocarbons and when we burn them the release carbon dioxide and other gases and particles along with heat energy. Combustion reactions are chemical exothermic reactions that occur between a fuel and an oxidant. They generate heat that powers up our homes, our cars, planes, and even light itself. We often perform combustion reactions in our everyday lives ourselves. Furthermore, respiration, the process of which cells in your body break down glucose and oxygen to release energy, is also an exothermic reaction. Finally, neutralisation, when an acid reacts with a base to form water and a salt, is also an exothermic reactions.
