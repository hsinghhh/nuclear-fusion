<p align = right class = 'other'> <b>Nuclear energy is a form of energy released from the nucleus, the core of atoms, made up of protons and neutrons.  </b> 
  <br> <br> Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a single heavier one while releasing massive amounts of energy. Fusion reactions take place in a state of matter called plasma- a hot, charged gas made of positive ions and free-moving electrons that has unique properties distinct from solids, liquids and gases. To fuse on our sun, nuclei need to collide with each other at very high temperatures, exceeding ten million degrees Celsius, to enable them to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion. Once the nuclei overcome this repulsion and come within a very close range of each other, the attractive nuclear force between them will outweigh the electrical repulsion and allow them to fuse. For this to happen, the nuclei must be confined within a small space to increase the chances of collision. In the sun, the extreme pressure produced by its immense gravity create the conditions for fusion to happen. The amount of energy produced from fusion is very large- four times as much as nuclear fission reactions, and fusion reactions can be the basis of future fusion power reactors. Plans call for first-generation fusion reactors to use a mixture of deuterium and tritium which are heavily types of hydrogen. In theory, with just a few grams of these reactants, it is possible to produce a terajoule of energy, which is approximately the energy one person in a developed country needs over sixty years. </p>

<p align = left class = gen-energy> NUCLEAR FISSION: </p>
<p align = left class = 'other'> Nuclear fission is a reaction where the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, while releasing energy. For instance, when hit by a neutron, the nucleus of an atom of uranium-235 splits into two smaller nuclei, for example a barium nucleus and a krypton nucleus and two or three neutrons. These extra neutrons will hit other surrounding uranium-235 atoms, which will also split and generate additional neutrons in a multiplying effect, thus generating a chain reaction in a fraction of a second. Each time the reaction occurs, there is a release of energy in the form of heat and radiation. The heat can be converted into electricity in a nuclear power plant, similarly to how heat from fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil is used to generate electricity. </p>

<p align = middle class = gen-energy> FISSION VS FUSION: </p>
<br> <div class = parent> 
<p align = middle class = 'other'> Fission occurs when a neutron strikes a heavy and unstable atom. This collision causes the atom to split into 2 lighter atoms. In the process, a large and stable quantity of energy and new fissions of atoms continue to be triggered on an ongoing basis, which is known as a chain reaction. In this operation, the fuel used is uranium 235. Its composition and physical properties are perfectly suited to the fission process. The atomic nucleus of uranium 235 is capable of splitting in 2 under the impact of a neutron. 
  A controlled nuclear fission reaction releases one million times more energy per kg than a chemical reaction such as burning coal, oil or gas. This means much less fuel is required than for a conventional power station which keeps transportation and mining costs low and reduces the associated hazards.
</p>
<p align = middle class = 'other'> Fusion, however, is still at the experimental stage. It is more difficult to put into practice because of the need to meet extreme conditions of pressure and temperature. The process is equivalent to the nuclear reaction which takes place at the core of stars, like our Sun (thus requiring a temperature of hundreds of millions of degrees). Nuclear fusion reproduces the combination of 2 isotopes (type of atoms with an identical number of protons) of hydrogen: deuterium and tritium.
  The fusion of these stable and light isotopes of hydrogen gives rise to a helium atom. It is this reaction which releases a large quantity of energy. One of the major benefits of deuterium is that it is available in unlimited quantities in the Earth's oceans. Combined with tritium (which is not very unstable), this radioactive mixture can generate a quantity of energy sufficient to meet the growing demand of global populations.   </p>
