<h1 class = 'heat'> Heat </h1>
<p class = 'fade-in'> <b>In thermodynamics, heat is the thermal energy transferred between systems due to a temperature difference. </b> 
<br> <br>
In everyday use, heat sometimes refers to thermal energy itself. Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of vibrating and colliding atoms in a substance. The particle theory of matter is a series of five postulates written by Democritus in 430 BC. The postulates are that:
<br> <br> • All matter is composed of tiny indivisible particles too small to see;
<br> • These particles do not share the properties of the material they make up;
<br> • There is nothing in the space between the particles that make up matter;
<br> • The particles which make up matter are in constant motion in all physical states; and
<br> • This speed is affected by their temperature, as when more heat is added, both the temperature and speed of the particles increases
<br> <br> The hotter an object is, the more its particles like to move around. This means that the particles in solids vibrate about fixed positions; even at very low temperatures while the particles in liquids and gases have no fixed positions and move chaotically. The particle theory of matter is able to explain the entirety of heat, as when a substance is heated, its particles gain internal energy and move more vigorously. Then, the particles bump into nearby particles and make them vibrate more. This passes internal energy through the substance by conduction, from the hot end to the cold end. These changes of state are physical, however, the amount of a substance both before and after the state change remains the same.

<br> <br> Thermal energy tends to move from an object or region with a higher temperature to one with a lower temperature. For example, if Object A and Object B are connected, and Object A has a higher temperature than Object B, heat moves from Object A to Object B, causing Object A's temperature to decrease and Object B's temperature to increase. This also means that Object A's average kinetic energy is decreasing and Object B's average kinetic energy is increasing. 
<br> <br> Heat plays a critical role in the lives of humans and other organisms- all of which are systems. It gives us comfort by warming our skin, while helping to maintain optimal body temperatures. For humans, heat helps in preparing foods, warming homes and manufacturing goods. Heat generated by sunlight helps plants to mature and develop fruit, and heat also helps to shape local and global weather patterns. The term heat is sometimes confused with the term temperature, although they have distinctly different meanings. Temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of a system's atomic particles, whereas heat is concerned with the transfer of thermal energy, which results from the kinetic energy generated by moving particles. Temperatures can be measured in Fahrenheit, Celsius or Kelvin. Heat can be measured in joules (J), calories (cal) or British thermal units (BTU).

<p align = 'leftt' class = 'other'> 
    Heat can be produced in many ways such as burning, rubbing, and mixing one substance with another. The four main ways to generate heat are:
    <br> <br> • Thermal Energy- produced by the sun, fire (burning fuel such as gas, wood, paper, cloth, etc.), mixing chemicals, shaking liquids together, electricity, and friction;
    <br> • Solar Heating- Passive solar heating systems aim to capture the sun's heat within the building's elements;
    <br> • Geothermal Energy- Geothermal technologies allow us to use Earth's heat to power heating and cooling systems, resulting in heat;
    <br> • and, Chemical Energy- Chemical energy is the energy of chemical substances that is released when the substances undergo a chemical reaction and transform into other substances, which results in heat generation
   <div class = container> <br> <br> Conductors are great substances that generate heat, while insulators are substances that generate minimal amounts of heat (it wouldn’t be fair to say that insulators don’t conduct any heat, but they don’t generate enough to make an impact). Conductors are usually metals such as copper, while insulators are things such as rubber.
    One great heat generator is heat pumps- they are known for their efficiency, sometimes even producing as much as four times the electricity that powers them, and they do not burn fossil fuels to generate heat, nor do they create harmful gases during operation (no carbon monoxide risk here).

  <img align = 'left' src = "Heat Transfer Diagram.png" alt = "Heat Transfer Diagram"
  width = "300"
  height = "220"> Heat can be transferred in four main ways: conduction, convection, radiation and perspiration
  <br> <br> • Conduction- the process by which heat energy is transmitted through collisions between neighbouring atoms or molecules. 
  <br>• Conduction occurs more readily in solids and liquids, where the particles are closer together than in gases, where particles are further apart;
  <br> • Convection- the process of transferring heat through air or liquid currents. Convection causes liquid or gas to heat up, expand, and decrease in density. This causes movement of the liquid or gas in a convection current;
  <br> • Radiation- Radiation is energy that comes from a source and travels through space at the speed of light. This energy has an electric field and a magnetic field associated with it, and has wave-like properties. You could also call radiation “electromagnetic waves”. Once these waves hit a surface e.g. you, it heats up that surface; and
  <br> • Perspiration- When the body gets hot, it perspires, meaning a salty, watery fluid is secreted by the sweat glands of the skin. This fluid is then evaporated, in turn cooling down the body
